## What is Campus Wayzz?

Campus Wayzz is a location discovery mobile application that will enable users to find services and spaces on campus that they can relax, eat, study, or exercise. Additionally, Campus Wayzz allows users to create custom Meetups with other users. This allows users to send their friends an invitation to join the meetup, which will share each user's location with the rest of the group and give each individual directions to the group's destination. Additionally, if the user doesn't have Campus Wayzz open, you can get a custom link to send to your friends over text, which will bring them to the app to join the Meetup.
