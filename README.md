## What is Campus Wayzz?

Campus Wayzz is a location discovery mobile application that will enable users to find services and spaces on campus that they can relax, eat, study, or exercise. Additionally, this service will allow users to enter new locations that they have discovered, rate the space, and describe their experiences. Lastly, users will be able to see where their friends are currently on-campus in order to gather with them.
